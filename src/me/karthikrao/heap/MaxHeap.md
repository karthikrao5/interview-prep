Max heap implementation with array

Two main properties of heaps:
1. order
2. shape

shape means the heap tree is a complete binary tree meaning that a full level is filled out before going to next level. Each node must have a left and right child with the exception of the last row where new nodes are added

order means that in a max heap, the parent is always greater than or equal to the child. Min heap is the converse.
